Hi I'm Nick Larsen I an a software engineer. My interests include:
* CAD/CAM programming C/C++ 
* Machine Learning
* Keyboard Programming
* Clean Code!

Here are a few of my favorite Side projects:
* [GAN Training Discriminator weight Setback](https://nbviewer.org/github/stevenjohnlarsen/GAN-discriminator-refresh-learning/blob/main/CelebAGAN.ipynb) - Attept to traing GANs with a new approach to holding back the discriminator's training. [Weight Setback Paper](https://github.com/stevenjohnlarsen/GAN-discriminator-refresh-learning/blob/main/Discriminator_Weight_Stepback.pdf)
* [Learned Rubiks](https://github.com/nlarsensmu/LearnedRubiks) - iPhone app written in swift to teach solving a Rubik's Cube
* [Classifying Brain Cells](https://nbviewer.org/github/nlarsensmu/CNN/blob/master/Merged%20work.ipynb) - Jupyter Notebook for classifying Brain Cells as cancerous
* [Visualizing Conv. Neural Networks](https://nbviewer.org/github/nlarsensmu/Visualizing-VGG/blob/master/Lab2-Class-Approch.ipynb) - Attempt to understand how a deep convolutional neural network learns image classification. Inspired by [open ai microscope](https://openai.com/blog/microscope/)
* [Connect 4 AI](https://nbviewer.org/github/nlarsensmu/CS7320-AI/blob/master/Games/assignment_connect5.ipynb) - Jupyter notebook, that is a bot playing connect 4.
* [Style Transfer](https://nbviewer.org/github/stevenjohnlarsen/StyleTransfer/blob/main/StyleTransfer2.ipynb) - Jupyter notebook to transfer artist's style to faces.
